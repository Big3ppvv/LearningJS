# Exercise 5

## Problem

It is necessary to create a function that takes a parameter "list" that it's an array with numbers and valuate if it has repeated numbers inside 

## Solution 

It was created a function named "repeatedValue" that takes the parameter named before, then it was created a const assigned "object" that it's an empty object and after that it was made a forEACH that gave us an element and index and with this it was made a "if sentences" that depends of the condition was true push the index in the "value" of the hashmap or if was false create a hash map with the element like a "key"and the index like a "value".
And finally it was created a normal for loop that runs through the const object and again made if sentences that values if the index's values contains has a lenght of 1 or no.
