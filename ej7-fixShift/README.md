# Exercise 7

## Problem

In order to understand the behavior underneath the arrays, replicate the shift method logic in O(n) time complexity.
 
## Solution 

It was created a shift function that takes a parameter "newObject" and verify if the lenght of the parameter is equal to 0. And then it was created 2 consts, one with the first element deleted and the other with the keys of the elements of "newObject". And finally with a for loop it was created a const key that must order the keys correctly, decrease the lenght object property, delete the last repeated element and return the new object.
