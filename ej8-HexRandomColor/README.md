## Problem

It is necessary to make 3 files (HTML, CSS and Javacript files) for create a page and it must to show random color with HEX code.

## Solution 

It was created a function named "makeHexColor" that can takes a random letter and number of the hex code and make a complete hex code. Next with the DOM structure takes a element by the ID and we add an event listener. With this event we create a background style in the body tag and we put a text in the h2 tag
